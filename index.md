* Lab 3
      
      Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite of mine because we had to make a sandwich madlib word game that would describe a sandwich order. This lab helped me understand how and when to utilize variables such as std::cout, std::cin, and std::string when coding. When I ran the program I was able to fill in the blanks to describe a sandwich order of whatever I could think of.

 * Lab 4  

      Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite of mine because we had to use int variables to be able to calculate the number of days between two dates. Testing the program and seeing if the code worked was also interesting. It showed me how the calculator apps we use everyday on our phones and computers are made. 

 * Lab 2

      Lab 2 was a favorite of mine because it was our first time checking format and lint. Checking lint and formatting gets rid of style errors in our code and helps eliminate potential bugs. This showed me how important code quality is when coding and its affect on the ability to run a program.
